Ultimately the issue is due to gilts being used as collateral for derivatives and the huge increase in gilt yields forcing margin calls therefore requiring pension funds to sell assets (liquid or otherwise) to meet those margin calls. Given the systemic nature of the issue, the Bank of England (BoE) had to step in to buy gilts and thus stabilizing yields.
